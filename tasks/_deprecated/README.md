# Deprecated Tasks

These tasks are archived from the active tract-level pipeline but kept for reference.

Archived tasks:
- `estimate_gravity` (legacy distance-based gravity estimates)
- `compute_travel_times_bg` (block-group travel times)
- `download_block_groups` (block-group geographies)
- `download_lodes_bg` (block-group LODES pull)
- `estimate_gravity_bg` (block-group gravity estimation)

Current active gravity task:
- `estimate_gravity_travel_time` (GTFS travel-time-based gravity used by inversion/counterfactuals)
